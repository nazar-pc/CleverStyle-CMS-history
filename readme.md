This is pre-git history of CleverStyle CMS.

First build 0.001 was created on 13 February, 2011. Looks like that was first build that somehow worked together and was worthwhile to save.

All this builds were actually just zip, and later tar.bz2 archives of CleverStyle CMS state snapshots, most of them was able to run (some of them not, but there was too many changes and there was a need to make snapshot).

CleverStyle CMS development was started from scratch, from empty directory and creating empty `index.php` inside. It took few months to get to version 0.001 (first mentioning that system is under development is 10 October, 2010).

From the beginning it was developed under Windows OS with different versions of Macromedia/Adobe Dreamviewer. Later transition to Ubuntu Linux hapened, which results in discovering awesome JetBrains PhpStorm IDE, and eventually development goes under Git version control system.

This is just a brief overview of early times of CleverStyle CMS development.

Switching to Git started at version 0.087, and starting from this version all history is available in main Git repository.

It is interesting sometimes to look back and recall how thoughts were changing, approaches varied and from what it started to what it eventually become.
